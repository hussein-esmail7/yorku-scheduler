## What is this?
This program inputs a JSON file generated by
[yorku-class-scraper](https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/yorku-class-scraper),
and the building and room you are looking for. This will output a LaTeX `tex`
file that has the entire week's schedule of that class.

### Why is this a separate program?
It's a separate program because if anyone wants to make something out of just
[yorku-class-scraper](https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/yorku-class-scraper),
they can (without all of this LaTeX conversion in this program).

## Requirements
- python3
- pdflatex (recommended, for converting `.tex` file to `.pdf`)

## Installation
At the moment, you can only `git clone` this repository.

### Installing Through Git
```
git clone https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/yorku-scheduler
cd yorku-scheduler/
```

## Running the program
To use this program, you have to make sure you are in the correct directory
(using the `cd` command).

```
python3 yorku-scheduler.py <args>
```

### Arguments
Here are possible arguments you can call in Terminal:
```
-h, --help --> Help message and exit program.
-j, --json --> Input the JSON path as a string.
-o, --output --> Input the output file name as a string.
-r, --room --> Input the room as a string.
-s, --sem, --semester --> Input the semester you want as a string.
-q, --quiet --> Quiet mode. Only display text when required.
```

Example:
`python3 yorku-scheduler.py -j "../yorku-class-scraper/json/su_2022_all.json" -r "db 0011" -o "test2.tex" -q -s "SU"`
