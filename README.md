## What is this?
This program inputs a JSON file generated by
[yorku-class-scraper](https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/yorku-class-scraper),
and the building and room you are looking for. This will output a LaTeX `tex`
file that has the entire week's schedule of that class.

### Why is this a separate program?
It's a separate program because if anyone wants to make something out of just
[yorku-class-scraper](https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/yorku-class-scraper),
they can (without all of this LaTeX conversion in this program).

## Requirements
- python3
- pdflatex (recommended, for converting `.tex` file to `.pdf`)

## Installation
At the moment, you can only `git clone` this repository.

### Installing Through Git
```
git clone https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/yorku-scheduler
cd yorku-scheduler/
```

## Running the program
To use this program, you have to make sure you are in the correct directory
(using the `cd` command).

```
python3 yorku-scheduler.py <args>
```

### Arguments
At the moment, there is not functionality to input your options right in the
command line, but this will be added later. At the moment, the program will ask
you for these options directly after you start it.
